# Pterodactyl Panel

PterodactylÂ® is a free, open-source game server management panel. More information on the platform can be found at this [link](https://pterodactyl.io/).&#x20;

Pterodactyl is used to manage the creation and maintenance of our Minecraft servers. It offers a nice GUI to view your server console, and resources, create backups, manage files etc. This is pretty much the industry standard when it comes to server management.
