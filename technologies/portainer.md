# Portainer

Portainer is a Docker and Kubernetes management software. More information the platform can be found at this [link](https://www.portainer.io/). \
\
Portainer is used on our server to manage all of our docker containers for our Panel, Database, and Wings Interface for creating/managing our Minecraft servers. It provides a nice interface to do actions like restarts, access logs and updating of the docker containers easily.
